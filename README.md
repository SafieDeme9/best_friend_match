## Context 
With my friends, we have a group of armys (fans of [BTS](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLkAepWjdylmXSltofFvsYQ) the famous korean boy bands) and it's during our discussion that i have the idea of matching them. Some people were close but the others no. During our convos( in my dms or in the groupchat) 
i felt that some people could be very good friends.

## The form
The inspiration of the form came from the [Myers-Briggs](https://www.16personalities.com/free-personality-test). I tried to make the questions more kpop oriented.
You can find the copy of the form [here](https://forms.gle/jbgC46VzmZbqi3dN7). The form is in french.

## The algorithm
As you can see in the form the answers are from 1 to 5. I write a algo that calculates the distance beetween the answers of everybody. The shortest the distance is, the more compatible the couple is. 

I used the python library [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) to treat the data.
